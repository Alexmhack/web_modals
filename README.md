# Project Objective
Every website has cookies system, and website has to show an notification about the cookies policy
that website uses for its users so for that, website shows the notification about the cookies
policy once on any page that tha user has visited and not every time the page reloads and also
not on a certain page but on each page that website has but only once.

We can accomplish this objective using the lessons we learned in the brandflow about the page url,
we can set the starting of the page url and then show our new users the cookie policy once on each
url of our website.
